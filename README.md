# Unduck ⛔🦆⛔

## 📝 Usage
Visit the following website, configure your default "bang", hit `apply`, and set your browser's search engine to the given url.

**[https://unduck.vaisriv.com](https://unduck.vaisriv.com)**

The configuration of a default bang is optional: the built-in default is Google, but others like Duckduckgo, Ecosia or Bing can be set with `!ddg`, `!ec`, or `!b`, respectively. From now on, any bang you provide in the search field of your browser will be used to redirect to the corresponding search engine. This is useful for one-off searches of Google Images, Wikipedia, Youtube, or whichever else you want. Unduck supports all of DuckDuckGo's bangs, which they maintain an extensive list of [here](https://duckduckgo.com/bang_lite.html).

## ⚠️ Fork Notice
This is a fork of [Theo Brown](https://t3.gg/)'s [Unduck](https://github.com/t3dotgg/unduck), a custom "search engine" url redirector (through the use of DuckDuckGo-style bangs), with modifications made by [Deer-Canidae](https://github.com/Deer-Canidae).

## ℹ️ Motivation
Theo's version does not have support for customizing the default bang. This feature was [heavily requested](https://github.com/t3dotgg/unduck/issues/35), and implemented by [Deer-Canidae](https://github.com/Deer-Canidae), whose work can be found on their [repo](https://github.com/Deer-Canidae/deer-search) and in this [pull request](https://github.com/t3dotgg/unduck/pull/84).

Unfortunately, after about a month and half, Theo (the sole maintainer, and who is likely busy with his ongoing work on [ping.gg](https://ping.gg)) has yet to merge Deer's PR. Getting impatient, I have decided to host my own instance of Unduck, available at [unduck.vaisriv.com](https://unduck.vaisriv.com). I have done my best to attribute credit to both Theo and Deer on the site, but I am open to any suggestions on how to better acknowledge their work.

## 📓 Acknowledgements
As well, I implore you to support the two of them, as they have both contributed far more to this than I have.
